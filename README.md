# StolzeChat

A simple socket.io chatroom with identification via browser fingerprinting.

## Buy why?!
Even in large student residences, it is sometimes difficult to connect with others when the university demands a lot of you. To make it easier for people to get in touch with each other, I wanted to have an uncomplicated and, for the time being, anonymous way to connect. The StolzeChat is an attempt in this direction.
